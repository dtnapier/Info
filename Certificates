GoDaddy provides a .crt file.  
On MARS-DC1 go to IIS > Server Certificates > Complete CSR to install the certificate.  
Export it to get the .pfx file. For password use MidAmerica20xx (the year).  
To get a .key file, install OpenSSL on your computer 
Open Admin cmd 
cd C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin 
openssl pkcs12 -in <pfxfile>.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem -nodes 
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out server.key 
Now you have a .crt, .pfx, and .key file.  

To change on the web servers go to IIS > Server Certificates > Complete CSR. Use the .crt file.  
Then go to the sites and Edit Bindings. Check every one and change the certificate as necessary.  
When done you can remove the old certificate.
